# CHANGES — applied substitutions

This port applies the Cursor → Claude Code substitutions in skill bodies. Earlier drafts left them flagged; this revision resolves them.

## Substitution table

| Cursor primitive | Replaced with | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Task` tool | `Agent` tool | Claude Code's `Agent` tool is the equivalent. |
| `subagent_type: generalPurpose` | `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` | Kebab-case in Claude Code. |
| `subagent_type: "poteto-agent"` | `subagent_type: "poteto-agent"` | Unchanged — this plugin ships that agent. |
| `readonly: true` / `readonly: false` | (dropped; rewritten as "pick a subagent_type that retains MCP access") | Claude Code controls tool/MCP access via subagent_type, not a per-call readonly flag. |
| `AskQuestion` | `AskUserQuestion` | Tool rename; semantics match. |
| Cursor `/loop` (built-in) | Claude Code `loop` skill | 1:1 replacement; available as a built-in skill. |
| Cursor `/babysit` (built-in) | This plugin's `babysit` skill | New Claude Code analog at `skills/babysit/` wrapping `gh` + `loop`. |
| Cursor `/create-skill` (built-in) | `plugin-dev:skill-development` skill | Claude Code's authoring guidance for SKILL.md. |
| `cursor-team-kit` `/deslop` | This plugin's `deslop` skill | Ported in (only team-kit skill imported). |
| `cursor-team-kit` `control-cli` | `run` skill (Claude Code built-in) | Drives CLIs/TUIs. |
| `cursor-team-kit` `control-ui` | `verify` skill (Claude Code built-in, VS Code extension) | Drives UIs (browser/Electron). |
| `~/.cursor/projects/*/` transcripts | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl` | `<encoded-cwd>` is the workspace's working directory with `/` → `-`. |
| Cursor `agent-transcripts/` dir | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/` | Same as above. |
| `.cursor/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, `~/.cursor/plugins/` | `.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/plugins/` | Path-only translation. |
| Cursor `mcps/` directory | Tool list at top of system prompt (`mcp__<server>__<name>` prefixed entries), or `.mcp.json`, or `claude mcp list` | Discovery surface differs. |
| Model: `composer-2.5-fast` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Fast workhorse Claude. |
| Model: `claude-opus-4-X-thinking-xhigh` | `claude-opus-4-8` (with note "extended thinking" where it appeared in a table) | Claude Code uses model IDs without the Cursor UI suffix; extended thinking is a separate knob. Originally substituted to `4-7`, then bumped to `4-8` to match the current Claude family. |
| Model: `gpt-5.3-codex-high-fast`, `gpt-5.5-high-fast` | `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5` | Within Claude Code, cross-vendor diversity isn't native. Skills that need a harsher pass now route to the bundled `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` skill (imported from cursor-team-kit) as the escape hatch. Different style of pressure (strict maintainability rubric), not vendor diversity. |

## New / imported files

- `skills/babysit/SKILL.md` — Claude Code analog of Cursor's `/babysit`. Wraps `gh pr view` / `gh pr checks` / `gh run view --log-failed` plus the `loop` skill for pacing. Provenance: workflow informed by Cursor's public /babysit behavior. Not a copy of Cursor's closed-source implementation.
- `commands/babysit.md` — slash command routing to the babysit skill.
- `skills/thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review/SKILL.md` — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Used as the harsher-critique escape hatch in `arena`, `interrogate`, `architect`, and `how` (replaces the Cursor-original cross-vendor bridge).
- `commands/thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review.md` — slash command stub.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — marketplace manifest so the repo is installable via `/plugin marketplace add michael-denyer/pstack-claude`. Declares `allowCrossMarketplaceDependenciesOn: ["claude-plugins-official"]` so the cross-marketplace dependency on `plugin-dev` resolves at install time.
- `plugin.json` `dependencies` — declares `plugin-dev` (from `claude-plugins-official` marketplace) as a required dependency, since the rewiring routes skill-authoring tasks to `plugin-dev:skill-development`.

## Per-skill changes applied

### `skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md`

- Triggers section: `create-skill` → `plugin-dev:skill-development`; `deslop` "from `cursor-team-kit`" qualifier dropped; `control-cli`/`control-ui` line replaced with `run`/`verify` driver guidance; `Cursor's built-in **babysit**` → this plugin's `babysit`.

### `skills/poteto-mode/references/plan.md`

- `AskQuestion` → `AskUserQuestion`.

- `composer-2.5-fast` → `claude-sonnet-4-6` (replace_all).
- `claude-opus-4-8-thinking-xhigh` → `claude-opus-4-8` (replace_all for inline; table cell updated separately).

- Phase B runner slugs: GPT/composer → Claude family. Added cross-vendor-bridge note.

### `skills/show-me-your-work/SKILL.md`

- Transcript audit path: `agent-transcripts/` + `~/.cursor/projects/*/` → `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl`.

## Deliberately not changed

- **`claude-opus-4-8` model ID.** Already a valid Claude model; no edit needed beyond stripping the Cursor `-thinking-xhigh` UI suffix. Extended thinking is configured separately, not as a model variant.
- **`/loop`, `/deslop`, `/babysit` slash references.** These all resolve in Claude Code now (`loop` is a built-in skill; `deslop` and `babysit` ship in this plugin).
- **`run_in_background: true`.** Claude Code's `Agent` tool supports this — kept as-is.
- **"currently open files, recent edits, the cursor location"** in `why/SKILL.md` (line 59). "Cursor location" here means editor cursor (caret position), not the IDE; generic phrasing, no edit.
- **`poteto-agent` subagent ID.** Plugin ships this agent; references stay.
- **Cursor's `/create-skill` writing style guidance referenced indirectly.** Pointed at `plugin-dev:skill-development` which covers the same ground in Claude Code. If you want stricter parity, also install Anthropic's `superpowers:writing-skills` skill.

## Forking note

This port now diverges from upstream pstack content. To track upstream:

```bash
# diff against the pinned commit
diff -ru /tmp/pstack-src/pstack/skills/ skills/  # caveats: ignores the babysit/ and deslop/ dirs
```

If you want a clean re-port (e.g. when upstream releases v0.2.0), the rebuild recipe is:

1. Copy upstream skills verbatim.
2. Re-apply the substitution table above (most of it is mechanical find/replace).
3. Re-add `skills/babysit/`, `commands/babysit.md`, and the cursor-team-kit `deslop` import.

## Provenance

- Upstream pstack: [cursor/plugins/pstack @ 11ecc12](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/11ecc12a3ffc037b4ef3b64de2be449668e8afc7/pstack) — MIT, (c) 2026 Lauren Tan.
- Upstream deslop: [cursor/plugins/cursor-team-kit/skills/deslop @ 11ecc12](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/11ecc12a3ffc037b4ef3b64de2be449668e8afc7/cursor-team-kit/skills/deslop) — MIT, (c) 2026 Cursor.
- babysit: independently authored; workflow informed by Cursor's public /babysit behavior.
- Inspected for prior-art decisions: [v1truv1us/ai-eng-system](https://github.com/v1truv1us/ai-eng-system) (namespaces pstack under `pstack/` but keeps Cursor refs intact); [Evan-Kim2028/agent-fleet](https://github.com/Evan-Kim2028/agent-fleet) (vendors pstack under `base-kit/pstack/`, same posture).
