description: Configure which models pstack uses per role. Detects your available Claude models and writes a per-role override file that the user can include from their CLAUDE.md. Use for /setup-pstack, "configure pstack models", changing pstack's model choices, or turning the SessionStart hook on or off.

# Setup pstack

On Codex, read the [platform mapping](../poteto-mode/references/codex-tools.md), including its per-skill notes, before following this skill.

On another runtime, read [Other runtimes](#other-runtimes) below for where the sheet lives and how it loads; the steps are the same.

Write `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`, a per-role model override sheet you include from your global `CLAUDE.md`. Each pstack skill names a default model inline; the override sheet is the layer that adapts those defaults to the models you actually have access to.

Claude Code has no auto-applied "rules" mechanism like Cursor's `.mdc`. Inclusion is explicit: the user adds a line to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (or their project `CLAUDE.md`) such as:

```text
@~/.claude/pstack-models.md
```

so the file is loaded as context for every session.

## Steps

### 1. Detect available models

Enumerate the model slugs you can pass to an `Agent` subagent in this session — that is the dependable source. The currently available Claude models and the default panel are listed in [Models](#models) below; the quad is chosen for cross-family, cross-tier diversity, and the single-role default stays out of the panels because it already covers the single-model roles. Ask the user to confirm or paste any additional slugs they want available. Never write a real slug you have not confirmed is available. The aliases `inherit-parent` and `auto` are always valid even though they are not detected slugs; both mean the role runs on the parent session's model, which the `Agent` call expresses by omitting `model`.

### 2. Load current state

The default role-to-model mapping is the rule shape shown in the Write the override sheet step below. If `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` already exists, read it and treat its values as the current choices. Otherwise start from those defaults.

### 3. Map and confirm

Show every role with its current model, marking any real slug not in the detected set as needing a choice. Ask whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit-parent` and `auto` as the options. Prefer `AskUserQuestion` over free text. For panel roles (arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, alias entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena selects one value from it whose model family differs from the parent's when possible. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

### 4. Choose whether the session hook routes tasks

On Claude Code the plugin's `SessionStart` hook injects the poteto-mode mandate on startup, `/clear`, and after compaction. Ask whether to keep it. The default is on. The answer is the `session hook` line in the sheet: `on` or `off`. The hook reads that line from `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` before injecting anything; with no sheet or no line it injects. Other runtimes have no session hook, so the line is inert there.

### 5. Validate

Every real slug written must be in the detected set; `inherit-parent` and `auto` always pass. If a chosen real slug is not available, stop and ask again.

### 6. Write the override sheet

Write `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` with the shape below. Overwrite the whole file so re-runs stay idempotent.

```markdown
# pstack model configuration

Per-role model overrides for pstack skills. Each pstack SKILL.md names its defaults in a Models section; the values here override those defaults. Delete a line to fall back to the skill default. A value of `inherit-parent` or `auto` runs that role on the parent session's model (the `Agent` call omits `model`); an alias entry in a panel list still counts toward that panel's fan-out. `session hook: off` stops the Claude Code SessionStart hook from injecting the poteto-mode mandate; any other value, or no line, leaves it on.

### 7. Wire it in

If `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` does not already include `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`, append the `@~/.claude/pstack-models.md` line so it loads on every session. If the user prefers project scope, add the include to the project's `CLAUDE.md` instead.

### 8. Confirm

Tell the user where the override was written and how it loads (via the `@` include in CLAUDE.md). Re-running this skill updates the override sheet.

## Other runtimes

The role lines are the same everywhere. What differs is the sheet path, how the runtime loads it, and how you list models. Detect models with the runtime's own tool and never write a slug you have not seen listed. A runtime whose subagent call has no model parameter still gets the sheet, as the record of the user's choice, and applies it where it can. The `session hook` line applies to Claude Code only.
